<h1>📝 RECENT PROJECTS</h2>
<h3><a href="https://itsfinal.net">ITSFINAL</a><br></h3>
<p></p>
<h3><a href="https://readytoreact.net/">Ready to React</a><br></h3>
<p>I organized and taught a <strong>5-session React course</strong> to university students in-person at lecture theatres, with each session lasting 1 hour. The course covered the fundamentals of React, and I was responsible for all aspects of the course, including planning, teaching, and creating the resources. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBBCnAkawyU">first session</a> to get started!</p>

<h3><a href="https://cs261-prod.pages.dev/">Junction Flow</a><br></h3>
<p>Developed as part of the Software Engineering module at university, this project models traffic flow through a junction. I personally handled all the programming and used it as an opportunity to learn the React Flow library.</p>
<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/nFrap_AjdP4?si=6MdG9qj0C7nYvRTy">The CORS of Errors</a><br></h3>
<p>This is a Lightning Talk I gave during my first year at university on Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The talk was inspired by the book <i>CORS in Action</i> and covers the motivation behind CORS, its integration into browsers, and provides insights into the preflight process.</p>
<h3><a href="https://symboltracker.net">Symbol Tracker</a><br></h3>
<p>A site that helps Destiny 2 players unlock secrets within the game. Since its launch in 2022, it has assisted over a thousand players and received praise from the community.</p>
<h3>Echocast [Coming Soon]<br></h3>
<p>Currently being developed as a fan project for Tom Clancy's The Division 1, this site will allow users to listen to in-game lore recordings. I'm using this as an opportunity to explore audio integration in web apps, focusing on seamless audio playback and enhancing the user experience.</p>
